\section{Summary}

The Center of Internet Security offers benchmarks against which to test a Kubernetes cluster. Aqua Security provides the kube-bench implementation for CIS scans and can mitigate the findings. Kubernetes platforms, such as SUSE's Rancher, integrate kube-bench and CIS Benchmarks into their offering.

The CIS Benchmarks cover CIS Controls v8 4.1, which corresponds to Article 21 2(g) of the Network and Information Systems Directive II.

For now, we can conclude that the CIS Benchmarks will help enterprises to fulfill and monitor the requirements for basic cyber hygiene as outlined in Article 21 2(g).

Upcoming legislation, such as the KRITIS-DachG ("Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie (EU) 2022/2557 und zur St√§rkung der Resilienz von Betreibern kritischer Anlagen"), and the NIS-2-Regierungsentwurf will further strengthen the security posture of IT systems in Germany and the EU.

Regardless of future developments, governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance will remain critical topics in Enterprise IT, and the CIS Benchmarks are a good tool for monitoring IT systems compliance.

Happy Ranching!
